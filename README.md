# Datasets in Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science for Foundation Models Training
## Overview
In the era of Generative AI, empowering AI systems with mathematics & reasoning capability is becoming an indispensable requirement. Such capability has always been one of the golden standards to gauge intelligence, human or artificial.

This project aims to collect/curate datasets on mathematics and theoretical computer science, and train/fine-tune open source fundation models to solve problems in areas including, but not limited to the following:

- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics
- Ordinary Differential Equations
- Partial Differential Equations
- Optimization (linear, nonlinear, convex)
- Numerical analysis
- .........
- Recursion
- Boolean Algebra
- Trees, Graphs
- Searching/sorting algorithms, BFS, DFS, etc.
- Time and space complexity
